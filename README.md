# Project-Face-Generation

## Introduction ##
This repository holds the fourth project on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

This project will use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces by training a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
